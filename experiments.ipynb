    "In this project, 4 models have been trained namely a baseline encoder that averages Glove embeddings to produce a sentence representation, 2 LSTM-based models that output the last hidden state as the sentence embedding, and a LSTM-based model that does max pooling over the hidden states outputted by the LSTM layer. The performance ranking of these models is the following in descending order from best to worst:\n",

    "2) BiLSTM last hidden state\n",
    "3) LSTM last hidden state\n",
    "4) Glove embeddings average\n",
    "\n",
    "The Baseline encoder, the one that just averages word embeddings and does not learn anything is expected to perform worst since it does not learn specialized weights for the SNLI dataset. The LSTM models that use the last hidden state of the LSTM layer as the sentence representation should perform better than the baseline because we actually learn weights specific to the given dataset and it incorporates information from all the tokens in the sentence. It is worth mentioning here that the BiLSTM should be better than the Unidirectional LSTM because when aggregating information about the sentence into the last hidden state of the LSTM layer, most of the information about the tokens at the beginning of the sentence is going to be mostly lost because of the forgetting mechanism incorporated into the LSTM layers. This behavior is exacerbated for longer sentences, so using sentence information from both directions barely solves this issue. Last but not least, the Max Pooling BiLSTM should perform the best out of these models because it actually uses the most useful features from each token from both directions according to the LSTM layer."
